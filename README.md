# Algorithm Study
This is a repository for my algorithm problem solving and study records.

Each problem includes both the **solution code** and a **write-up (README.md)** describing the idea and approach.

## Programming Language 
* Python

## Problem Source
* **Baekjoon Online Judge:** https://www.acmicpc.net/

## Folder Structure
```bash
├── ProblemNumber/
│   ├── ProblemNumber.py        # My solution code
│   └── README.md         # Problem analysis & solution approach
├── README.md
```
For example:
```yaml
